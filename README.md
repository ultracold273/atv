## 🛠️ Development

### Prerequisites

- Android Studio Ladybug (2024.2.1) or later
- JDK 17+ (Embedded in Android Studio)
- Android SDK API 35 (Target), API 29 (Min)

### Build & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ultracold273/atv.git
cd atv

# Build Debug APK
./studio-gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device/emulator

### Testing on Emulator

The app includes a `studio-gradlew` wrapper script that configures the Java environment automatically.

To test local streams (e.g., udpxy) on the emulator:
1. Ensure your local server allows cleartext traffic (configured in `network_security_config.xml`).
2. Use `adb reverse tcp:PORT tcp:PORT` to forward ports if needed.
3. Use `10.0.2.2` to access the host machine's localhost.
